Trajectory
==========

These are initiatives that members from the LSH community can lead, contribute to, and organize around. If you want to lead an effort, please prove it through your actions. Because this community is highly experimental, its currently easier to determine dedication to an initiative through extended active participation. Further steps to formalize these stand out leaders will be made accordingly.

##Meetup Organizer
* I need someone to help post about meetups going on each week during hackathon season
* You don't have to be present, just every monday, make a post about the hackathons going on the following weekend and ask who wants to host the meetup. Then when a volunteer steps forward, you make that person the meetup host. 

##Resource Maintainer
* A lot of people are looking for coding resources. There desperately needs to be an organized repository of these things.

##LSH Conference
* I think it would be AWESOME to have an LSH conference at the end of the year
* First things first, we need a viable location

*Got other things to suggest? Make a pull request.*
